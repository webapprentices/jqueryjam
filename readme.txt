jQuery jAM

jQuery jAM is an initiative coordinated through Boston PHP Meetup, a not-for-profit organization focused on technology education. The initiative began life in September 2011 as a virtual self-study group designed to help members learn new technology skills.

This website is being developed as a value-added resource for Web designers and developers interested in achieving proficiency in JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery Mobile technologies.

Three other websites are scheduled to be built colaboratively in 2015 including the following:

~ phppercolate.com
~ html5brunch.com
~ drupaldiner.com

In addition, another colabroative website is under construction.  It will be built in Drupal and will promote Boston PHP's "200 Days of Code" initiative.
